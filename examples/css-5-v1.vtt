00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
A Comprehensive History of C S S, Institutions, Specs, and Practice.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Executive Summary. C S S, Cascading Style Sheets, has evolved through parallel tracks:

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
the formal progression of W three C specifications and the informal ways developers actually used C S S in practice.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Over nearly three decades, these tracks have continually influenced each other.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Key phases include: Early Standards: C S S was born from the need to separate content from presentation on the Web.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Håkon Wium Lie's one thousand nine hundred and ninety four proposal for Cascading style sheets,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
with the novel idea of blending author and user styles,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
led to C S S Level one in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Early adoption was slow due to limited browser support and a perception that C S S could only handle basic styling.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Pioneering sites like C S S Zen Garden dramatically demonstrated C S S's potential by using one H T M L file with multiple C

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
S S designs, helping shift the industry from table-based layouts to C S S-based design. C S S one, C S S two, C S S two one:

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The W three C's C S S Working Group published C S S one defining basic styling,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
fonts, colors, spacing, then C S S two adding layout features like absolute positioning and media types. However,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
full C S S two proved ambitious,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
browser interoperability lagged,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
and parts of C S S two were later removed or deferred.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
C S S two one emerged as a refinement,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
focusing on what implementations agreed on,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
it became a W three C Recommendation in two thousand eleven after a decade of revisions.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
This long stabilization period gave browsers time to catch up,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
and by two thousand eleven,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
C S S two one was effectively the baseline of,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
modern C S S, support. Modular C S S three and, No C S S four: To avoid monolithic spec bottlenecks,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
the C S S Working Group split C S S into modular specifications after C S S two one.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Each module, Selectors, Color, Flexbox, Grid, et ceteraadvances on its own, Level.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
All modules at Level three were informally termed, C S S three, but there was never a single C S S three spec.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The Working Group explicitly moved away from version numbers, there is no C S S four.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Instead, modules increment to Level four, Level five, et ceterawhen they add new features.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
For example, Selectors Level three was followed by Selectors Level four, ongoing, but we don't call this, C S S four.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The current state of C S S is defined by C S S Snapshots, which collect the stable, interoperable specs at a point in time.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
This modular approach has allowed C S S to evolve faster and more incrementally,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
though it requires developers to track many spec modules.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Browser Wars to Evergreen Browsers:

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Through the two thousands,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
browser engines, Trident or I E, Gecko or Firefox, Presto or Opera, WebKit or Safari, raced to implement, and often extend,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
C S S features, sometimes with proprietary or prefixed syntax. This led to inconsistencies, edot g.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
each engine required-moz-, -webkit-, et ceteraprefixes for new C S S properties.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Around two thousand twelve, concerns grew that-webkit-only, C S S on popular mobile sites was fragmenting the web.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The community responded with tools like Autoprefixer to automatically add needed prefixes,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
and the W three C encouraged cross-vendor standards efforts.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
By the mid-two thousand and tens,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
browsers adopted rapid-release,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
evergreen, cycles, Chrome, Firefox, Edge-Chromium, and collaborated on interoperability. Today,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
only three major engines remain,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Chromium or Blink, WebKit, Gecko, and they coordinate on implementing features similarly, a far cry from the early chaos.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Vendor prefixes are now largely a historical footnote,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
with official guidance that experimental features be behind flags rather than exposed in public with prefixes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Community Practices: In practice, developers continually innovated techniques to fill C S S gaps.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Early on, complex layouts were achieved with H T M L tables or floats, until C S S gained new layout systems.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The late two thousands saw grid frameworks like Blueprint and nine six zerodot gs which used floats anddot col classes to

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
create multi-column grids.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
As projects grew, maintainability issues led to C S S methodologies: edot g.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
O O C S S promoted reusable, objects, and separation of structure from skin,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
B E M introduced a strict naming convention to make styles predictable and avoid conflicts,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
S M A C S S provided a categorization scheme for styles,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
base, layout, module, state, theme. Preprocessors like Sass and L E S S emerged, adding variables, nesting,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
and functions to C S S authoring,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
which became standard team tools by early two thousand and tens.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
In the mid-two thousand and tens, PostCSS enabled a plugin ecosystem, with Autoprefixer its most famous plugin.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The late two thousand and tens brought a shift toward component-driven U I development,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
giving rise to C S S-in-J S solutions that co-locate styles with JavaScript components,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
and utility-first C S S frameworks like Tailwind that trade semantic class names for speed and consistency.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Spec and Practice Convergence:

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Modern C S S incorporates solutions to many long-time pain points,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
often informed by those community practices.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
For example, C S S now has flexbox and grid layout, eliminating the need for float-based grids.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
We have C S S custom properties, variables, reducing reliance on preprocessors for theming.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
New features like cascade layers address stylesheet architecture challenges that methodologies like B E M and I T C S S tried

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
to solve, managing specificity across large codebases.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Native C S S nesting is arriving, inspired by Sass's popular nesting syntax.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The: has, selector allows parent or ancestor styling once only possible with JavaScript.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And container queries fulfill the responsive design community's wish to style components based on their container size,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
not just the viewport. In effect, the formal spec process has sped up to deliver authors more powerful, ergonomic tools,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
often modeled on ideas proven in the field.
